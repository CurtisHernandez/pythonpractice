# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print
# out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn
# 100 years old.

# Extras:

# Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and
# printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of
# operations exists in Python)
# Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint:
# the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)
    
import datetime
    
print("Hey homie what's your name?")
name = input()
print("How about your age?")
age = int(input())

now = datetime.datetime.now()

message = ("Cool, that means that you're going to be 100 years old in the year " + str(now.year - age + 100) + ".")
print(message)
print("Hey: \nwhy don't you pick another number for me to repeat the previous message by so I can get extra credit?")
repeatnum = int(input())

for i in range(repeatnum):
    print(message)
