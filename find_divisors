# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list
# of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it
# is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a
# divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

print("Hi, I am a robot that figures out lists of divisors for real integers.")
print("Give me a positive integer.")
number = int(input())

divisors = []
for i in range(1,number):
    if number % i == 0:
        divisors.append(i)

print("The divisors for " + str(number) + " are:")
print(divisors)
