# Just like in R, lists can contain data objects of a bunch of different types
# You can also have lists of lists, and you can index in the index (indexception lol)
# so like:

babysFirstList = ['this', 'is', 'a', 'list']
babysSecondList = [70, 71]
babysFirstMetaList = [babysFirstList, babysSecondList]
babysFirstMetaList[0][1]

# There are some weird ways you can slice your lists that you don't see in other languages
babysFirstList[:2] # if you leave out the beginning of a slice, it's 0
babysFirstList[1:] # if you leave out the end of a slice, it's end

# You can delete stuff from lists which is kind of nice
del babysFirstList[1]
babysFirstList

# You can use "in" and "not in" to see if an object is in, or not in, a list
'this' in babysFirstList #evaluates to True because it's in there
'this' not in babysFirstList #evaluates to False because it's not not in there

# Remember multiple assignment?
Rush = ['Geddy', 'Alex', 'Neil']
bassist, guitarist, drummer = Rush
